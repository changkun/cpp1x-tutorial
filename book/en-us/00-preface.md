# Preface

## Introduction

C++ is a fairly large langauge which is used by many users around the globe. From the advent of C++98 to the official finalization of C++11, it has accumulated over a decade. C++14/17 is an important addition and also an optimization to C++11. The extended features of all these new standards inject new life into the C++ language.
C++ programmers who are still using C++11/14/17 are still in the process of using **traditional C++** (this book refers to C++98 and its previous C++ features as traditional C++). When it comes to new features such as Lambda expressions, it even reveals the excitement of "not learning the same language."

**C++1x** or **modern C++** (both refer to C++11/14/17) A number of features are injected into traditional C++ in order to make C++ more like a modern language. C++1x not only enhances the usability of the C++ language itself, but the modifications of the `auto` keyword semantic gives us more confidence in manipulating extremely complex template types. At the same time, a lot of enhancements have been made to the language at runtime. The emergence of Lambda expressions has made C++ have the "closure" feature of "anonymous functions", which is almost used in modern programming languages ​​(such as Python/Swift/..) It has become commonplace, and the emergence of rvalue references that has solved the problem of temporary object efficiency for which C++ was criticized for a long time.

C++17 is the direction that has been promoted by the C++ community in the past three years. It also points out an important development direction of **Modern C++** programming. Although it does not appear as much as C++11, it contains a large number of small and beautiful languages ​​and features (such as structured binding), and the appearance of these features once again corrects our programming paradigm in C++.

Modern C++ also adds a lot of tools and methods to its own standard library, such as `std::thread` which is at the level of the language itself, which supports concurrent programming and no longer depends on the underlying system on different platforms. The API implements cross-platform support at the language level; `std::regex` provides full regular expression support and more. C++98 has been proven to be a very successful "paradigm", and the emergence of C++1x further promotes this paradigm, making C++ a better language for system programming and library development.

All in all, as an advocate and practitioner of C++, we always maintain an open mind to accept new things, and we can promote the development of C++ faster and better, making this old and novel language more vibrant.

## Targeted Readers

1. This book assumes that the reader is already familiar with traditional C++, at least not having difficulty reading traditional C++ code. In other words, those who have long used traditional C++, who are eager to quickly understand the features of **Modern C++** in a short period of time, are well suited to reading this book.

2. This book introduces some Modern C++ **black magic** to a certain extent, but these magics are limited, and are not suitable for readers who want to learn Modern C++. The positioning of this book is the quick start of **Modern C++**. Of course, readers who want to do advanced learning can use this book to review and test their familiarity with **Modern C++**.

## Purpose of the book

This book is called "high-speed start-up". It is a relatively comprehensive introduction to the relevant features of C++ produced before the 1920s. Readers can learn the content of interest according to the following catalogues and learn quickly. What you need to know. These features don't need to be fully mastered. Just learn and review the new features that are right for you based on your own usage needs and specific application scenarios.

At the same time, in the process of introducing these features, the book introduces the historical background and technical requirements of these features as simple and clear as possible. This book is a great help to understand these features and how to apply them.
